# How to run Korespond-app in local envoirnment with or without docker-compose a complete step by step guide Please follow the instructions.

Korepsond-app is a MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) application. The application includes a backend API and a frontend UI. This guide will show you how to run the application both with and without Docker Compose.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm (v6 or higher)
- Docker (optional, for Docker Compose setup)
- Docker Compose (optional, for Docker Compose setup)

## Running the Application

### Running without Docker Compose

#### Backend Setup

1. **Navigate to the backend directory**:
   
   open terminal and to your korespond-app path

   cd korespond-app/backend

    Install dependencies:

     npm install

    Start the backend server:

     npm start

    The backend server will run on http://localhost:5000.

Frontend Setup

    Navigate to the frontend directory:

    cd korespond-app/frontend

    Install dependencies:

     npm install

    Start the frontend server:

     npm start

    The frontend server will run on http://localhost:3000.

MongoDB Setup

    Install MongoDB:
    Follow the official MongoDB installation guide for your operating system.

    Start MongoDB:

     mongod --dbpath /path/to/your/mongodb/data

    MongoDB will run on mongodb://localhost:27017.

Update backend environment variables:
Ensure that the backend server is configured to connect to MongoDB. You may need to set the MONGO_URL environment variable:

    export MONGO_URL=mongodb://localhost:27017/mern-sample

Running with Docker Compose

    Ensure Docker and Docker Compose are installed:

        Frontend: http://localhost:3000
        Backend: http://localhost:5000
